echo "- Internal Services: Hybrid scaling (1-3 replicas)" 
echo "- External Traffic: Routes through KEDA HTTP interceptor"
echo "- Internal Traffic: Direct Kubernetes service communication"

echo -e "\n${BLUE}üéØ What's Working vs. Future Enhancements:${NC}"
echo -e "${GREEN}‚úÖ WORKING:${NC}"
echo "  - Gateway auto-scaling based on HTTP traffic"
echo "  - Internal service communication within cells"
echo "  - All CRUD operations on services"
echo "  - Health checks and service discovery"

echo -e "${YELLOW}üìù FUTURE (requires app code changes):${NC}"
echo "  - Cross-cell communication with full scale-to-zero"
echo "  - Complete application-level Host header support"
echo "  - See APPLICATION_CHANGES_REQUIRED.md for details"
